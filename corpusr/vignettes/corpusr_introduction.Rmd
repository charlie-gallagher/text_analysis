## Introduction
The `corpusr` package shows you words in context. Given a corpus, broken down into individual works and within those works into individual sentences, you can query that corpus for all instances of a given word. The main unit of work is the `cps_corpus`, which is merely a collection of `cps_book` objects. These objects provide print methods to improve readability of the selections, always giving the author and the name of the work.
